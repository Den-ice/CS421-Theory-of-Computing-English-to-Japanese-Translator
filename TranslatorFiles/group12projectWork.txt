GROUP#12

Must have divided the work as specified.
1.State who did what by indicating: 
  Member A tasks (getEword) - who:Denice Hickethier
  Member B tasks (gen) - who:Denice Hickethier
  Member C tasks (dictionary) - who:Ivan Inandan
  Who updated which parser functions with getEword and gen
  calls? Ivan updated the parser functions that were under his name and Denice Hickethier 
  updated the rest of the parser and updated those for those who needed fixing. Phoenix 
  Nitta-Hill coded only the parser functions under her name for the whole project, then only 
  did the grading sheet and report for this project.

If the member did not fully contribute to the assigned part,
do not list his/her name!!!!!

2. Each person came to the meeting? NO

3. You have included all the required comments?
   (updated the grammar rules in comments?) YES

4. The project produced correct output for all 6
   test cases? I believe all cases have been corrected.
   

5. If you did EC error recovery,
   test 7 worked and produced translated.txt
   and errors.txt?
   EC was not done with the recovery.

   Thank you for being so lenient and an amazing professor. I know this is way past the deadline
   but if you could regrade this and the .out I resubmitted that would be amazing. 

   Thank you for this past semester.

   Denice Hickethier

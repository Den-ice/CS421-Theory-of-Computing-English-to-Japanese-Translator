2.  Each person came to the meeting?
    Yes
3.  You have included all the required comments? 
   (Grammer rules and Programmer names)
    Yes
4.  The parser produced correct output for 
    all 6 test cases?
    No, there are some issues I think may be with the scanner. The functions work properly
    but some table token types may be out of order. One of us will make an appointment 
    with you to straighten out our program.
5.  What extra credit feature did you include?
    If it is error correction, did you make sure errors.txt
    got produced?
    They output but are not written to an errors.txt
    [ You may still do EC later ]
